At first I was unsure whether I was going to post this video here or not, but you see where my decision has taken me. I wanted to create one of those popular typography videos that display the lyrics of a song in a very nice fashion. The song of choice was Ding by German reggae band Seeed.

However, once having worked a little more than a day, I found that the song was nice, but didn’t really fit into what I was trying to make. And it was getting quite tedious. So I stopped with the intention of creating a new one, of something shorter with a bit more… well, stuff behind it. Sounds weird, but I don’t know how else to put it.

I was just able to animate the first four lines of text and create a moving camera for my first project. It doesn’t look too shabby, but it definitely lacks the creativity that I only found right after rendering it out.

Now I’m still looking for a fitting candidate for my second try. Be it another music title, a movie scene or a bit of a good comedian talking. I’m actually leaning towards the last option at the moment, it sounds quite fun actually. Maybe take something from Jim Gaffigan, Bill Burr, Eddie Izzard or Demetri Martin. Sounds like a really fun project when I think about it.
Other choices are Papercut from Linkin Park or the Knights of the Round Table by Monty Python, though that second one again sounds like a great choice. Especially because it’s quite short and I’ve already had some great ideas.

Do you guys have any great ideas?

(What’s kind of odd is that YouTube somehow managed to cleanly cut the background out of the shot. The original file had a nice radial dark blue gradient in the back, which is gone in the YouTube version. Weird…)

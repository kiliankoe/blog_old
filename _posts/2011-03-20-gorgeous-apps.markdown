I recently created a minimalistic Tumblog just for the purpose of sharing beautiful iPhone applications. You can find it at [gorgeousapps.tumblr](http://gorgeousapps.tumblr.com/) or even on Twitter at [@gorgeousapps](https://twitter.com/gorgeousapps).

Check it out if you too adore great app design. On a sidenote I definitely want to recommend the blog [Beautiful Pixels](https://beautifulpixels.com/) from Milind Alvares, who keeps on picking out true gems. Follow him!

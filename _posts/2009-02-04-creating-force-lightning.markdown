I just finished another tutorial today. Recorded it this morning, rendered it out at noon and have been uploading to YouTube until now. Yes, I know, my upload speed s***s!

I’ll show you exactly how you can create some really cool looking Force Lightning that could just have been used in the actual movie. I don’t know what else I should write, it’s basically all described in the tutorial itself.

Have fun watching!

Unfortunately the sound effect is no more. It was lost when migrating between blogs a long time ago. It was downloaded over 2000 times. If you’re not one of those people, I really hope you’re not too disappointed.

In this Photoshop tutorial I’ll show you how easy it actually is to colorize a black and white photograph or picture. It’s actually a LOT easier than it may seem.

P.S. This is one of my first tutorials in a very long time. I wasn’t prepared very well so please excuse me acting up a little doing the process. Nevertheless I think the point I was trying to show was understandeable.

If you encounter any problems whatsoever or have any questions or suggestions, please write a comment!

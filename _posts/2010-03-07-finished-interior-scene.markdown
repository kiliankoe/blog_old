Ha! It has been done! Took about 2 weeks of my laziness to complete, but it was worth it! Just take a look, it’s awesome.

This is what I was working on. It’s an interior scene featuring a modernistic living room. The coffee table is supposed to be made of glass, which is not rendered transparent due to the nature of this basic clay rendering. The TV itself is actually in the middle, between the two speakers and behind the glass, but still attached to it. Some details I really enjoy are the DVD cases under the TV, the cactus, the curtains and the books on the coffee table.

I have to admit that this was part of a training series that I acquired from Digital Tutors. My Maya skills were a bit “rusty” and this training has so far been a really fun and definitely useful way to make them shine again. I’ve certainly found the feeling again. ‘Twas a good choice!

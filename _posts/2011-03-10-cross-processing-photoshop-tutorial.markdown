Ever wanted to do that cool effect everybody is posting their pictures with? You know the one. It’s called cross processing and is extremely easy to achieve in Photoshop. It also has an almost unlimited number of possible outcomes, so you can be really creative with it.
The stock image is (as mentioned) from stock xchange. Just search for drogheria.

If you encounter any problems, have any questions, or anything else (e.g. long metal objects stuck in your forehead, too many squirrels in your frontyard – not backyard, I DO NOT SUPPORT BACKYARD PROBLEMS – or maybe even UFO sightings) just leave a comment. And if you don’t… also post a comment. So no matter what you do, you have to comment, there’s no way out! There never was one… muahahaha

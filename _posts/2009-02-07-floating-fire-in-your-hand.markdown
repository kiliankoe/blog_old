So I made another tutorial. I recorded this yesterday and have only had problems since then. Rendering wouldn’t work, uploading wouldn’t work and so forth. Finally it worked out though, so here you go:

This time we’ll be creating some really cool looking floating fire in Sam Loya’s (from Videocopilot.net) hand. I had no access to any other footage of a hand like that, so I took this one.

I hope you enjoyed it! If you do, please comment, rate the video and subscribe to my RSS here on the blog or to my YouTube channel. Either way you’re going to stay up-to-date on all tutorials and the other stuff.

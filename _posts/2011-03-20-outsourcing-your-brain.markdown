Once you have an iPhone (I’m basing this post on me, feel free to substitute the word iPhone with a smartphone of your choice), you pretty much lost any choice of ever walking around without it. Once you have gotten used to outsourcing vital portions of your brain, leaving the house without it or even staying in the house without it is no longer an option.

Yesterday I forgot my iPhone in the car and didn’t have access to it for a few hours. I know this might sound ridiculous, but I really did feel like part of my brain was missing. All of my data is stored on there. All of the data that I would normally try to keep memorized.

A few years ago (and even now) a lot of people carry around notepads/books and calendars. All based on the old paper format. I fail to see the advantage here. The most important thing about my data is that it’s always searchable and up to date. If I’m looking for something specific I know how to find it and I always do. And it’s universal. My notebook (Evernote) can capture whatever kind of data I want. Ideas in form of text, but also voice notes, locations, images and video. On paper you can only add text, write down where you are and maybe draw a picture, but that’s horrible compared to a quick camera snap of something you just want to keep saved until you’re at home.

I also find “local notes” extremely dangerous. What would you do if you were to lose your calendar? If you left it lying somewhere? Or your notebook? It’d be disastrous! But this problem can’t be fixed by just owning a digital device (after all, they have the additional risk of being able to “break”). That’s why I can never use an app that doesn’t somehow sync with a desktop version or even better: the cloud. Universally available data, that’s the dream. Being able to view and edit your calendar, notes and whatnot from whatever device no matter where you are. To a part that’s already possible with a beautifully working Google Calendar, Google Mail, Evernote, Dropbox and a few other brilliant services. And I really hope the development continues in this direction.

Now this post developed into something different than I had anticipated, but I hope it conveys my point, whatever that may be at.

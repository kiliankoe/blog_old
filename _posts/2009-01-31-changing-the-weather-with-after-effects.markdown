Quite a few times have I been wanting to change the weather. To get something a little more interesting than that normal, boring slightly cloudy and cold day. So today I tried something really quick. I took the camera, got on the balcony and spent just those 16 seconds out there. I spent absolutely no time planing anything, but I guess that’s what makes a quick test a quick test.

After choosing which clouds from the VideoCopilot DVD RealClouds I would incorporate into my project I spent a few minutes playing with the color correction and added rain and drops on the camera itself. Two sound effects later I was done already. I’m pretty satisfied as I’ve never done any kind of sky replacement either, but I guess the basics are the same as with other effects.

As I got a few questions on the Force Lightning tutorial on how to composite the lightning onto real footage I decided to make a quick video before I’d have to explain that over and over again through comments.

It’s a really simple process that actually just requires a drag&drop and the change of a transfer mode (which is Add).

After knowing how to do this you should be able to make your own awesome Force Lightning videos. Now please share them with the world and post them as video responses or just post links or whatever. I want to see them all.

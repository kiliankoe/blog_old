Hi, my name's Kilian and I'm a student at TU Dresden in Germany. I also like to write code. Mostly for things on iOS/OS X devices and the web, all the fun stuff. I'm also an ordained pastafarian minister and a lord of Sealand, 'cause those are important details.

Maybe I'll get around to writing up a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) some time soon. If I do, I'll link that up here.

If you're feeling particularly generous or in need of repaying me for that burger last Tuesday, I've got links for sending me Bitcoin via [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/kiliankoe) or *other* money via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/KilianKoeltzsch).

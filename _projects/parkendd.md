I have previously [blogged](/2015/02/26/parkendd.html) about the very first version of this. There's a bit about the background there, so check that out if you're interested. The data is currently being acquired by a python-powered server that periodically scrapes the relevant pages. More about that [here](/projects/parkapi.html).

There's also an [Android version](http://jkliemann.de/parkendd/) and a version for Windows Phone is currently in development.

As seen in the [SÃ¤chsische Zeitung](http://www.sz-online.de/nachrichten/studenten-helfen-bei-der-parkplatzsuche-3128007.html), the [Morgen Post](https://mopo24.de/nachrichten/dresden-kilian-keoltzsch-parken-dd-app-6754) and the [Ad Rem](http://apps.ad-rem.de/epaper/DMV_ADD_20150715_gesamt.pdf) (page 12) amongst others.
